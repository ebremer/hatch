# Hatch 3.0.0

This tool converts the largest image in a VSI, SVS, or TIF image into a new TIFF image with a freshly created image pyramid with each scaling 1/2 dimensions each scale.

Features:
1) Hatch transfers raw jpeg encodings from original image to new image to prevent any re-encoding image loss due to re-compression.
   OME Bioformats always decodes and then re-encodes when using their tools like bfconvert.

2) Only transfers max size from original source files and drops all other images including cover slide images

3) image pyramid is re-created from original image

Usage:
```
hatch -src <src> -dest <dest>

or see

hatch -help
```
